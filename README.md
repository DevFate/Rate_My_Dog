Goals
The styling for this challenge is up to you, feel free to use any UI libraries

This challenge has multiple goals that increase in level of difficulty, implement as many of these goals as you are able to.

Goal 1
Fetch a random dog image from the API and display it on the page.

Use the random endpoint of the API for this.

https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random

Goal 2
Add a form element that lets users submit their rating, along with a submit button. This can be as simple as a text field, and as complex as a star rating input element.

Goal 3
Once a rating has been submitted, load a new dog image and reset your form elements.

Goal 4
Add a section to your app where you can review the history of your dog ratings with both the picture and rating.

Note: this does not require a database, you can use a simple client side cache that only needs to persist until the page is refreshed.
 
Framework Used:
A framework like Bootstrap or Foundation can be used to organize the page into sections and create a consistent and responsive design. Here's an example of how you could use Bootstrap to organize the page:
Included the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in the <head> of the HTML document.

Implementation pending: In web development, data can be saved in the browser's cache using the Cache API, which allows you to create a local cache of resources that can be accessed by your web application even when the user is offline.

Here is an example of how you can use the Cache API to save data in the browser's cache: Goal 4
